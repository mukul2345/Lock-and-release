
## Smart Contracts

The project is made up of a total of three smart contracts: 
- **WERC20**: an ERC20 contract that allows for creation and minting of new tokens
- **Wrapper Tokan Factory**: a factory smart contract that manages all of the created `ERC20` tokens as well as hold some functionality.
- **Bridge** : Holds the main functionlity for transfering tokens between netowks by using an implementation of the `Factory contract`.

### WERC20

The `WERC20` contract etends `OpenZeppelin ERC20` contracts directly and does not have any extra implementation on top of that.

### Factory 

The `Factory` contract is a way create and manage `WERC20` tokens, it has methods to `create` , `mint`, `burn` as well as get the `balance` of a user.

These methods were created in order to add an extra layer of validation and a different way to access the tokens.
